# RUM Insights

Queries and data from the RUM Archive for use in RUM Insights visualizations.

To get started, look at `/docs` and look at `pipeline.js` (note: this needs manual steps to setup proper BigQuery API credentials that are currently undocumented).

For now, the idea is to use the data in `/data-output` directly as consumable "API endpoints" for use in RUM Insights visualizations.
